systems that turn machine/deep learning and AI research into great products for the customers. Let me share a personal story here.
Though during my work tenure back in India, I was majorly into backend development or Test Automation.
But During my Master, as part of my academic projects I launched various websites and I was impressed that I really do not have to buy some hosting or database. 
Now suppose you want to have website, it might have some peek traffic hours you really do not have to worry about the AWS does that for you.
It is also scalable by design, so if you site becomes successful you will have plenty of time on what matters on things such as better 
customer experience for an instance.










//Amazon is brand name. I can help Amazon preserve its leading in cloud computing and grow my career at the same time
AWS devision is also any sofwtare engineer dream job and Yes, i am type of person who gets excited to Build a complex

of keeping even your most difficult customers happy.
